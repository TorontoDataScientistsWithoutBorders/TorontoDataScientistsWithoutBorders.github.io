# Topic Outline
___

1. Why Simulation Methods and When
---
* (1) Simulation versus Asymptotic Assumed Optimization Methods

  - the latter uses asymptotic assumptions in population properties) for closed-form solutions while the former uses available observed available samples

* (2) Concept of Simulation

  - you have observed realizations from some target distribution
  - you try to build a pseudo-random number generator that mimics the underlying generation process of the observed realization



2. Non-parametric Bayesian versus MCMC

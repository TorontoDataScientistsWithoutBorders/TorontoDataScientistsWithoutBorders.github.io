PS: I LOVE Professor [Paul Gries](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries/), his beard become more white now than then but still, he is THE best professor I have seen ever, not even one of. I will add defend this statement later more.

Program
---
Run a program: **translate** a high-level **programming** language to a low-level **machine** language whose instructions can be executed

Translate: 

* Types:

            (1) Interpreted Language: (e.g. Python)
                        - translate and execute one statement at a time
            
            (2) Compiled Language: (e.g. C)
                        - compile the entire program (once), then execute(any number of times)
                        
            (3) Hybrid (e.g. Java)
                        - compile to someting intermediate(in Java, bytecode)
                        
            

Variable
---
1. need to declare a type for every variable as contrasted to **Python** where variable does not have a type and only object has

2. got reserved a space in memory for every variable declared's default value (default value will be given if not assigned specifically).

Methods
---
* main method:
            - default arguments?



Overloading
---
1. Method Overloading is an example of Static Polymorphism

more than 1 method having the same name even when argument lists are different in the same class/public interface too?

a) the argument lists of the the methods differ either in number of parameters or data types of parameters

b) place counts as differences in parameters orders 

for example

      int add(int, int)
      float add(int, int)
differ in return types and will throw a compilation error

2. Constructor Overloading

Unit Testing
---
JUnit is a Regression Testing Framework

* Features

            Fixtures
            - a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests

Read Input File
---
* [File Class](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_file_class.htm)

File object represents actual file/directory on the disk

            File(String pathname): creates a new File instance by converting the given pathname to  
            an abstract pathname (?what is an abstract pathname?)

Questions

1. what is **static** method

2. what is **JDK**, **JRE**, **JVM**

3. what is the difference between functions and methods

4. what is .jar file, what is classpath?

5. add JUnit5 to classpath?

6. what is a Test Root?

7. what is JUnit?

8. need to compile class one by one in IntelliJ, there are dependencies existing between classes

9. assertTrue

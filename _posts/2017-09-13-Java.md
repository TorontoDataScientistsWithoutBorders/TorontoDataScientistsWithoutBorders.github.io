PS: I LOVE Professor [Paul Gries](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries/), his beard become more white now than then but still, he is THE best professor I have seen ever, not even one of. I will add defend this statement later more.

Program
---
Run a program: **translate** a high-level **programming** language to a low-level **machine** language whose instructions can be executed

Translate: 
            Interpretation
            Compilation

Variable
---
1. need to declare a type for every variable as contrasted to **Python** where variable does not have a type and only object has

2. got reserved a space in memory for every variable declared's default value (default value will be given if not assigned specifically).

Overloading
---
1. Method Overloading is an example of Static Polymorphism

more than 1 method having the same name even when argument lists are different in the same class/public interface too?

a) the argument lists of the the methods differ either in number of parameters or data types of parameters

b) place counts as differences in parameters orders 

for example

      int add(int, int)
      float add(int, int)
differ in return types and will throw a compilation error

2. Constructor Overloading

Gradient Boosting = Gradient + Boosting
---
## 1. Boosting
    sequentially adding weak learners at each stage to compensate existing weak learners

## 2. Gradient
    identify shortcomings of exisiting weak learners


Algorithm

* At iteration i: model is $F_i(x_1)$, response is $y_1$, residual is $y_1 - F_i(x_1)$

let $h_i(x_1)$ = $y_1 - F_i(x_1)$
